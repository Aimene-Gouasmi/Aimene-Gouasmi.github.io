This seminar presented my PhD work on **flux reconstruction techniques** for elliptic interface problems, focusing on:

- construction of equilibrated fluxes in heterogeneous media  
- handling discontinuous coefficients and geometric singularities  
- guaranteed and local a posteriori error estimators  
- applications to adaptive mesh refinement and finite element computations

Numerical examples were shown using Python/FEniCS to illustrate the robustness of the estimators.
