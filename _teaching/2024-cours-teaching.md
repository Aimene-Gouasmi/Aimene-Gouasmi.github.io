I was responsible for tutorials and numerical laboratory sessions for the M1/M2 course on **Finite Element Methods**, including:

- weak formulation of PDEs  
- implementation of FEM in Python (FEniCS)  
- mesh refinement strategies  
- treatment of interface problems and singularities  
- a posteriori error estimation (gradient recovery, flux reconstruction)

I designed assignments, supervised projects, and assisted students during computer lab sessions.
